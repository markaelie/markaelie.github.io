		<h1 align="center">About Me</h1>
		<br>
		<p>Hey there! My name is Mark (markaelie). I am an Aesthetic Engineer / Game Developer / Digital Artist.
			From an early age, I was accompanied by paintbrush and watercolor. After few years I was attending
			drawing
			classes. Everything seemed to be going well, but something was missing. Drawing on different technologies
			for 8
			years
			(1999-2007), I was searching for my own orientation. After some years, when I got my first Dell Inspiron and
			was
			very
			familiar with three-dimensional games, I still had the feeling of dissatisfaction in my heart. Equally, I
			was
			interested
			in the fact how those games have been created. My interest in 3D was growing more and more, simultaneously
			the
			quantity
			and quality of games were increasing. In 2004 I got to know to Discreet 3dsmax 5 as the my first three
			dimensional
			toy.
			That time it seemed to be overwhelmingly difficult but at the same time tool with an interesting interface.
			Slowly I
			learned
			to work with my own mistakes. Within some years, those softwares and other tools of the industry became
			well-known
			and
			multifunctional tools for an individual work for me due to research. Continuing my education in Educational
			Complex
			of
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakob_Kojoyan" target="_blank">Hakob Kojoyan</a> (2004-2007), I kept
			on
			drawing which I have liked since childhood. At the final year of my studies,
			I came across to the brochure of
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Academy_of_Fine_Arts_of_Armenia" target="_blank">SAFAA</a>
			which was
			concentrated on the sphere of CG. Immediately after graduating (2007-2011) I got a job almost on the
			sphere of my specialization, working as a common 3D Artist. With an experience increased during years, I was
			approaching
			to my specialization more and more. Then I started working in different places as Senior 3D Artist. Getting
			enough
			skills
			and practice of teaching, I started teaching CG as well (
			<a href="https://tumo.org/en/" target="_blank">here</a>, for example). In 2015, I began to study
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" target="_blank">OOP</a> and
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine" target="_blank">FSM</a>, which allowed me to
			create
			interactive artworks. I have conducted master classes and got an experience of teamwork
			during years following the idea that all amazing projects are created due to stubborn work.</p>
