        <br>
        <p>Hey there! My name is Mark Hunanyan (Markaelie). I am an aesthetic engineer.
            <br>I was born in 1991 at the tender age of zero. From an early age, I was accompanied by paintbrush and
            watercolor. After a few years, I was attending drawing
            classes. Everything seemed to be going well, but something was missing. After some years, when I got my
            first computer <i>Dell Inspiron 7000 (this laptop was made in about 1997 or 1998 and was a low end laptop for the time)</i> and
            was
            very
            familiar with 3D games, I still had the feeling of dissatisfaction in my heart. Equally, I
            was
            interested
            in the fact of how those games have been created. My interest in 3D graphics was growing more and more,
            simultaneously
            the
            quantity
            and quality of games were increasing. In 2004 I met <i>Discreet 3dsmax 5</i>.
            That time it seemed to be overwhelmingly difficult and I like that feeling when you know something
            complicated like creating 3d primitives with special parameters or boolean objects together.
            Slowly I
            learned
            to work with my own mistakes. Continuing my education in <i>Educational
            Complex
            of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakob_Kojoyan" target="_blank">Hakob Kojoyan</a> (2004-2007)</i>, I kept
            on
            drawing which I have liked since childhood. In the final year of my studies,
            I came across the brochure of
            <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Academy_of_Fine_Arts_of_Armenia" target="_blank">SAFAA</a></i>
            which was
            concentrated on the sphere of CG. The Academy education was not so practical but fundamental <i>(2007-2011)</i>. After graduating I got a job almost on the
            sphere of my specialization, working as a common digital graphic designer. With an experience increased during the years, I was
            approaching
            my specialization more and more and I started working in different places as Senior 3D Artist. Getting
            enough
            skills
            and practice of teaching, I started teaching CG as well <i>(<a href="https://tumo.org/en/" target="_blank">here</a>)</i>. In 2014, I began to study programming, which allowed me to
            create projects like <i><a href="luneta.html" target="_blank">LUNETA</a></i>, <i><a href="playa.html" target="_blank">CODENAME PLAYA</a></i>, and <i><a href="https://github.com/markaelie/ProColor" target="_blank">ProColor</a></i>. </br>
            I got an experience of teamwork
            during years following the idea that all amazing projects are created due to the energy of passion.
