        <br>
        <p>
            Hey. My name is Mark Hunanyan aka Markaelie. I'm an engineer of digital aesthetics.
            <br>I was born in 1991 at the tender age of zero. From an early age, I was accompanied by paintbrush and
            watercolor. After a few years, I was attending drawing
            classes. Everything seemed to be going well, but something was missing. After some years, I got my
            first computer <i>Dell Inspiron 7000 (btw that laptop was made in about 1997 and was a low end laptop for the time)</i>. I
            was
            very
            familiar with 3D games, but still had the feeling of dissatisfaction in my heart. Equally, I
            was
            interested
            in the fact of how those games have been created. My interest in 3D graphics was growing more and more,
            simultaneously
            the
            quantity
            and quality of games were increasing. In 2004 I met <i>Discreet 3dsmax 5</i>.
            That time it seemed to be overwhelmingly difficult.
            Slowly I
            learned
            to work with my own mistakes.
            With an experience increased during the years, I was
            approaching
            my specialization more and more following the idea that all amazing projects are created due to the energy of passion.
