    <h1 align="center">About Me</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Hey there! My name is Mark (markaelie) Hunanyan. I am an aesthetic engineer.
      <br>I was born in 1991 at the tender age of zero. From an early age, I was accompanied by paintbrush and watercolor. After few years I was attending
      drawing
      classes. Everything seemed to be going well, but something was missing. Drawing on different technologies
      for 8
      years
      (1999-2007), I was searching for my own orientation. After some years, when I got my first Dell Inspiron and
      was
      very
      familiar with three-dimensional games, I still had the feeling of dissatisfaction in my heart. Equally, I
      was
      interested
      in the fact how those games have been created. My interest in 3D was growing more and more, simultaneously
      the
      quantity
      and quality of games were increasing. In 2004 I got to know to Discreet 3dsmax 5 as the my first three
      dimensional
      toy.
      That time it seemed to be overwhelmingly difficult but at the same time tool with an interesting interface.
      Slowly I
      learned
      to work with my own mistakes. Within some years, those softwares and other tools of the industry became
      well-known
      and
      multifunctional tools for an individual work for me due to research. Continuing my education in Educational
      Complex
      of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakob_Kojoyan" target="_blank">Hakob Kojoyan</a> (2004-2007), I kept
      on
      drawing which I have liked since childhood. At the final year of my studies,
      I came across to the brochure of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Academy_of_Fine_Arts_of_Armenia" target="_blank">SAFAA</a>
      which was
      concentrated on the sphere of CG. Immediately after graduating (2007-2011) I got a job almost on the
      sphere of my specialization, working as a common 3D Artist. With an experience increased during years, I was
      approaching
      to my specialization more and more. Then I started working in different places as Senior 3D Artist. Getting
      enough
      skills
      and practice of teaching, I started teaching CG as well (
      for instance <a href="https://tumo.org/en/" target="_blank">here</a>). In 2015, I began to study
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" target="_blank">OOP</a> and
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine" target="_blank">FSM</a>, which allowed me to
      create
      interactive artworks. I have conducted master classes and got an experience of teamwork
      during years following the idea that all amazing projects are created due to hard work.</p>
